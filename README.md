# Date Night

## About
This website serves to answer one of the most asked questions: "Where do you want to eat today?" A user can input a restaurant or food category, as well as their location and in return they get a randomly selected restaurant obtained from the Yelp API. In addition, they can also press a button that gives them randomly selected conversation starters to assist them during their date.
